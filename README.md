# devops3-Terraform-RMQ-AWS

 In this tutorial we build out a RabbitMQ infrastructure in AWS by using Jenkins to check out terraform and ansible repos and deploying. Make your infrastructure immutable and rebuild with a few clicks. 
 
 We will be using ansible's dynamic inventory to auto populate EC2 instances with a specific AWS group tag.
 
This tutorial is in response to a job listing on Linkedin that required Cloud experience, terraform, and RabbitMQ. Our Ansible script will auto create our user for us and we will be able to log into our RMQ admin dashboard.
